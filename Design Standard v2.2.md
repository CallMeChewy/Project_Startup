# Design Standard v2.2 - Enhanced AI Accountability Framework

## Author & Project

**Author:** Herb Bowers  
**Project:** Project Himalaya  
**Contact:** HimalayaProject1@gmail.com

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AI ACCOUNTABILITY PROTOCOL

### **THE PROBLEM STATEMENT**

**AI assistants consistently violate basic standards**, causing:

- ❌ **Time waste** debugging header inconsistencies
- ❌ **Deployment confusion** from incorrect file paths  
- ❌ **Production errors** from copy-paste timestamps
- ❌ **Process breakdowns** in automated systems
- ❌ **Path portability issues** from absolute path usage

**Previous attempts (v1.8, v1.8a, v1.9, v2.0, v2.1) have been improved but needed refinement.**

### **THE SOLUTION: ENHANCED AI COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK**

---

## 🎯 MANDATORY AI SESSION PROTOCOL

### **STEP 1: MANDATORY SESSION ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

**EVERY AI session MUST begin with this exact statement:**

```
🚨 DESIGN STANDARD v2.2 COMPLIANCE ACKNOWLEDGED 🚨

I commit to the following NON-NEGOTIABLE requirements:
✅ Search project knowledge for current Design Standard BEFORE coding
✅ Use ACTUAL CURRENT TIME in ALL headers (never placeholder times)
✅ Use RELATIVE PATHS from project base (not absolute system paths)
✅ Create unique timestamps for each file (no copy-paste headers)
✅ Verify header accuracy BEFORE functional changes
✅ Use PascalCase for all Python files and directories
✅ Announce file path changes with explicit verification

VIOLATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS = IMMEDIATE SESSION RESTART
```

### **STEP 2: MANDATORY PRE-CODE VERIFICATION**

**Before creating/modifying ANY file, AI MUST state:**

```
📋 HEADER VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
□ Current date/time determined: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMPM]
□ Target file path confirmed: [ProjectBase/Path/FileName.ext]
□ Deployment location verified: [Where will this actually be served/used?]
□ Path is relative to project base: [Confirmed/Not Confirmed]
□ Header will match deployment reality: [Confirmed/Not Confirmed]
□ Unique timestamp will be used: [Not copied from previous files]

PROCEEDING WITH FILE CREATION/MODIFICATION
```

### **STEP 3: PATH CHANGE ALERT PROTOCOL**

**When file paths change during session:**

```
🚨 CRITICAL PATH CHANGE ALERT 🚨
Original assumption: WebPages/index.html
ACTUAL deployment target: WebPages/desktop-library.html
Root cause: MainAPI.py routes /app → desktop-library.html

CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:
✅ Updating artifact header to match deployment reality
✅ Converting to relative path from project base
✅ Verifying all subsequent references use correct path
✅ Announcing change to prevent confusion

DEPLOYMENT IMPACT: [Describe how this affects automated systems]
```

---

## 📋 ENHANCED HEADER REQUIREMENTS

### **MANDATORY HEADER FORMAT - ZERO TOLERANCE**

```python
# File: [EXACT FILENAME WITH EXTENSION]
# Path: [RELATIVE PATH FROM PROJECT BASE - NO ABSOLUTE PATHS]
# Standard: AIDEV-PascalCase-2.2
# Created: YYYY-MM-DD
# Last Modified: YYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM[AM|PM]  ← MUST BE ACTUAL CURRENT TIME
"""
Description: [SPECIFIC PURPOSE - NO GENERIC DESCRIPTIONS]
[Additional context about functionality, dependencies, etc.]
"""
```

### **CRITICAL HEADER VALIDATION RULES**

#### **1. Path Relativity (NEW IN v2.2 - PRIORITY 1)**

- ❌ **WRONG:** `Path: /home/herb/Desktop/Project_Startup/README.md`
- ✅ **CORRECT:** `Path: Project_Startup/README.md`
- **Rationale:** Relative paths provide portability and cleaner project structure representation

#### **2. File Path Accuracy (PRIORITY 1)**

- ❌ **WRONG:** `Path: WebPages/index.html` when served as `desktop-library.html`
- ✅ **CORRECT:** `Path: WebPages/desktop-library.html` matching actual deployment
- **Validation:** Path MUST match where file will actually be deployed/served

#### **3. Timestamp Authenticity (PRIORITY 1)**

- ❌ **WRONG:** Identical timestamps across multiple files
- ❌ **WRONG:** Placeholder times like `HH:MM` or copied from examples
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Progressive timestamps showing actual creation sequence

#### **4. Description Specificity (PRIORITY 2)**

- ❌ **WRONG:** "Web interface for library system"  
- ✅ **CORRECT:** "Fixed Anderson's Library Web Interface - Desktop Twin"

## 🆕 NEW IN v2.2: PATH CONVENTIONS

### **Project-Relative Path Standards**

#### **For Project Files:**

```python
# Project: Project_Startup
Path: Project_Startup/src/main.py               # ✅ Correct
Path: /home/herb/Desktop/Project_Startup/src/main.py  # ❌ Wrong

# Project: CSM  
Path: CSM/enhanced_claude_monitor.py            # ✅ Correct
Path: /home/herb/Desktop/CSM/enhanced_claude_monitor.py  # ❌ Wrong
```

#### **For Shared Infrastructure:**

```python
# Project_BaseFiles (shared across projects)
Path: Project_BaseFiles/Scripts/ScriptMenu.py   # ✅ Correct
Path: ~/Desktop/Project_BaseFiles/Scripts/ScriptMenu.py  # ❌ Wrong
```

#### **For Generated Templates:**

```python
# Templates should use placeholder for project name
Path: {{project_name}}/README.md               # ✅ Template
Path: Project_BaseFiles/templates/README_template.md  # ✅ Template source
```

### **Path Resolution Rules**

1. **Project Base**: The directory containing the project (e.g., `Project_Startup/`)
2. **Relative Reference**: All paths relative to their project base
3. **Cross-Project Links**: Use full project name as base (e.g., `Project_BaseFiles/`)
4. **Template Variables**: Use `{{project_name}}/` for generated content

---

## 🔗 PROJECT_STARTUP INTEGRATION

### **Enhanced Project Creation Standards**

#### **Project_Startup Generated Files MUST:**

1. **Use Relative Paths**: All generated files use project-relative paths
2. **Progressive Timestamps**: Each file gets unique timestamp during creation
3. **Template Compliance**: All templates follow v2.2 standards
4. **Symlink Documentation**: Clear indication of symlinked vs. local files

#### **Configuration File Standards:**

```json
{
  "_header": {
    "file": "config_name.json",
    "path": "Project_Name/config/config_name.json",
    "standard": "AIDEV-PascalCase-2.2",
    "created": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "last_modified": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MMAM",
    "description": "Specific purpose of this configuration file"
  }
}
```

#### **Template File Standards:**

- All template files include proper headers
- Template variables clearly marked with `{{variable_name}}`
- Generated files automatically get correct relative paths
- Progressive timestamp injection during project creation

---

## 🛡️ ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

### **1. IMMEDIATE SESSION RESTART TRIGGERS**

**The following violations require immediate session restart:**

- Using placeholder timestamps (`HH:MM`, `XX:XX`)
- Identical timestamps across multiple files
- Using absolute paths instead of relative paths (NEW)
- File path not matching deployment reality
- Skipping mandatory session acknowledgment
- Creating artifacts without header verification checklist

### **2. THREE-STRIKE VIOLATION SYSTEM**

**Strike 1:** Header inconsistency - Warning + immediate correction
**Strike 2:** Repeated header violation - Process review required  
**Strike 3:** Systematic standards failure - Session termination

### **3. AUTOMATED VALIDATION INTEGRATION**

```python
# Enhanced validation for v2.2
def ValidateAICompliance(FilePath, HeaderContent):
    """
    Validates AI-generated files against Design Standard v2.2
    Returns: (IsValid: bool, Violations: List[str])
    """
    Violations = []

    # Check for placeholder timestamps
    if 'HH:MM' in HeaderContent or 'XX:XX' in HeaderContent:
        Violations.append("CRITICAL: Placeholder timestamp detected")

    # Check for absolute paths (NEW in v2.2)
    if HeaderContent.contains('/home/') or HeaderContent.contains('C:\\'):
        Violations.append("CRITICAL: Absolute path detected, use relative path")

    # Check path accuracy
    if not ValidatePathDeployment(FilePath, HeaderContent):
        Violations.append("CRITICAL: Header path doesn't match deployment")

    # Check timestamp uniqueness
    if DetectDuplicateTimestamp(HeaderContent):
        Violations.append("CRITICAL: Duplicate timestamp detected")

    return len(Violations) == 0, Violations
```

## 🎯 AI/HUMAN COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK

### **UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGE**

**AI assistants operate differently than humans:**

- ❌ Don't naturally track real time progression
- ❌ Tend to copy-paste patterns between files  
- ❌ May not understand deployment realities
- ❌ Default to absolute paths without project context
- ❌ Lack awareness of automated system dependencies

### **HUMAN OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS**

**Humans MUST:**

1. **Explicitly state deployment targets** when requesting files
2. **Verify AI session acknowledgment** before proceeding
3. **Specify project base context** for relative path calculation
4. **Spot-check headers** for compliance during development
5. **Immediately correct** any violations to prevent pattern repetition

### **AI ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS**

**AI assistants MUST:**

1. **Ask for clarification** when deployment location is unclear
2. **Determine project base** before creating relative paths
3. **State assumptions explicitly** and request verification
4. **Announce all file path changes** with impact assessment
5. **Use progressive timestamps** that reflect actual creation sequence
6. **Verify deployment reality** before finalizing headers

---

## 📊 COMPLIANCE MONITORING

### **SESSION-LEVEL METRICS**

- **Header accuracy rate:** 100% required (zero tolerance)
- **Timestamp uniqueness:** Must be 100% across all files
- **Path relativity compliance:** 100% required (NEW)
- **Path verification rate:** 100% required
- **Protocol acknowledgment:** Required at session start

### **PROJECT-LEVEL VALIDATION**

```bash
# Run validation on all project files
python Scripts/ValidateDesignStandard.py --version 2.2 --strict

# Expected output:
✅ All headers comply with Design Standard v2.2
✅ No duplicate timestamps detected  
✅ All file paths are relative to project base
✅ All file paths match deployment reality
✅ All descriptions meet specificity requirements
```

### **QUALITY GATES**

- **Pre-commit:** Validate all modified files
- **Pre-deployment:** Verify header compliance
- **Post-session:** Check for duplicate timestamps and absolute paths
- **Monthly:** Full project compliance audit

## 📝 VIOLATION EXAMPLES - LEARN FROM FAILURES

### **REAL VIOLATION: Absolute Path Usage**

```
❌ WHAT HAPPENED:
- File created with: Path: /home/herb/Desktop/Project_Startup/README.md
- Should have been: Path: Project_Startup/README.md  
- Root cause: AI used absolute system path instead of project-relative
- Impact: Portability issues, harder to understand project structure

✅ CORRECT APPROACH:
- AI asks: "What is the project base directory?"
- Human clarifies: "Project_Startup is the base"
- AI uses relative path from project base
- Path change announced with rationale
```

### **PREVENTION PROTOCOL**

```
🔍 PATH VERIFICATION QUESTIONS:
1. What is the project base directory?
2. Where will this file be deployed relative to project base?
3. Are there symlinks that affect the path structure?
4. Should this use a template variable for cross-project compatibility?
5. What's the impact of this path on automated systems?
```
